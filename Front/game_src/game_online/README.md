## 3D Pong Development with Three.js

### Overview
This part of the project involves creating a 3D pong game using Three.js. The current implementation includes the following features:
- A 3D arena for the game.
- Ball physics and interactions.
- 3D environment setup.
- Paddle controls and movements.

### Current Features
1. **3D Arena**: The game arena is designed using Three.js, providing a realistic environment for the game.
2. **Ball Physics**: Implemented realistic ball physics to simulate real-world interactions within the game.
3. **Paddles**: Added paddle controls for player interactions, allowing movement and collision with the ball.

### Next Steps
1. **Offline Normal Match Mode**: Implement a standard match mode that can be played offline.
2. **Offline Tournament Mode**: Develop a tournament mode for offline play, allowing multiple matches and progression.
3. **Online Modes**: Extend the normal match and tournament modes to support online multiplayer functionality.

### How to Run
1. Install dependencies using `npm install three`.
2. Install `http-server` using `npm install http-server`.
3. Run `http-server` in the Game's directory and search for `127.0.0.1:8080` your browser to see the game in action.

### Future Enhancements
- Improve the visual effects and animations.
- Add more interactive elements to the game environment.
- Optimize performance for smoother gameplay.
